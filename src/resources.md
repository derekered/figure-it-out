**Figure drawing** has a rich history that dates back to ancient times, with roots in the art of the Greeks and Romans. It became formalized in the Renaissance, where queer artists like [Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci) and [Michelangelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo) used figure drawing to study the human body and perfect their craft. In art schools, figure drawing remains a foundational practice, helping artists understand anatomy, proportion, and the subtleties of the human form.

The primary **purpose** of figure drawing is to capture the essence and movement of the human body. At Figure It Out it’s also a low-stakes and friendly environment to practice drawing. These are for rough drawings, not final pieces of artwork. It’s a practice that helps artists explore the beauty of human anatomy, gestures, and emotions. 

Beyond technical skill, figure drawing sessions are a celebration of the human body in all its diversity and uniqueness. Being a model for these sessions can be a wonderful act of self-empowerment. It is an incredible space to both see and be seen. 

There is plenty of **queer history** tied up with figure drawing too! Notable queer artists like [David Hockney](https://www.hockney.com/home) and [Paul Cadmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Cadmus) used figure drawing and live models to explore themes of identity, sexuality, and intimacy.
