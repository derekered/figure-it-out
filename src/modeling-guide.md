Welcome to Figure It Out! This guide is designed to help you prepare for and enjoy your experience as a model at a figure drawing session. Modeling is not only a celebration of the human form but also an empowering act of self-expression. Here’s everything you need to know to have a fantastic experience.

## Preparation

### Research poses

Start by looking up figure drawing poses at places like:

- [SketchDaily](https://www.sketchdaily.net/)
- [Line of Action](https://line-of-action.com/)
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/)
- [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/)

Consider saving reference photos to your phone that inspire you and reflect poses you’d like to try.

### Plan your poses

Think about the poses you want to do ahead of time. It helps to have a variety of poses — some standing, sitting, and reclining. Try to include poses that show different angles of your body and mix up big poses, small poses, and sharp angles.

Practice your poses in front of a mirror or with a friend to see how they feel and make adjustments if needed.

### Music and atmosphere

If you have specific songs or music that helps you get into the mood, share your playlist with the host ahead of time. Music can set the tone and help you stay relaxed.

### Bring essentials

- Robe: Bring a comfortable robe to wear during breaks. It’s important to stay warm and relaxed between poses.
- Venmo and Instagram: Send your Venmo QR code to the host beforehand so they can print it out for tips. You can also share your Instagram handle for promotion.
- Invite friends: If you feel comfortable, invite your friends to the event and promote it on your social media. It’s a great way to share the experience and get support.
- Additional props: Feel free to bring any additional props you might want to use, such as fun shoes or other accessories.

## During the event

### Understanding pose timings

Poses typically last between 2 to 15 minutes, but if you prefer longer or shorter poses, communicate with the host. Holding a pose can be more challenging than it seems, so be mindful of your body and take breaks when needed. There’s usually a break halfway through the session, but don’t hesitate to ask for a break if you need one sooner. The entire session usually lasts about 1.5 to 2 hours, with breaks included.

### Pose variety

Mix up your poses by facing different directions (front, side, back) to give artists a variety of angles to draw from. Try to incorporate standing, sitting, and reclining poses, and consider using the provided staff for support during longer standing poses. Consider the layout of the room; in venues like Vermillion, standing poses work well so everyone, including those in the back, can see.

### Comfort and attire

Typically, poses are done nude, but if you feel more comfortable wearing underwear or other clothing, that’s totally fine. Adding fun shoes or accessories can enhance the experience and add variety to your poses. You can also change clothes and accessories throughout.

You will have access to a chair, staff, pillows, and blankets to help with your poses and comfort during the session.

### Communicate with the host

The host will call out the timing for each pose and will look to you to see when you’re ready to start. Make sure to communicate if you need more time or if you’re ready to begin.

## After the event

### Engage with the community

After the session, feel free to stick around and chat with the artists. It’s a great opportunity to see the artwork created and connect with the community.

### Social media sharing

Many artists will tag you in their work on social media. Feel free to repost these artworks and ask for originals if there are any pieces you’d like to keep.

### Reflect and celebrate

Take a moment to reflect on the experience. Modeling is an act of bravery and self-expression. Celebrate your contribution to the artistic process and the empowerment it brings.

Thank you for being part of Figure It Out! Your participation not only helps artists improve their craft but also contributes to a vibrant, inclusive, and creative community. Enjoy the experience — you’re going to be amazing!
