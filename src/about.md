# About Figure It Out

## What is Figure It Out?

Figure It Out is a queer figure drawing community based in Seattle. We host regular figure drawing nights that center creativity, connection, and showing up as you are.

People with all kinds of relationships to drawing come together here. Some come to practice their craft. Others come to relax, meet people, and try something new. Many come for both.

There’s no pressure to be good and no expectation to perform. Just a shared room, a model, some paper, and time to draw together.

## Why We Started It

Figure It Out grew out of a feeling that something was missing.

Traditional figure drawing spaces can be quiet, academic, and isolating. Artists sit alone, heads down. Models and artists often feel on display rather than in community. Conversation is discouraged. The room can feel stiff and intimidating, especially for newcomers.

We wanted something different.

Figure It Out was created by [Derek Cutting](https://dcutting.com) with the incredible support of Diana at [Vermillion](https://www.vermillionseattle.com/) to be warmer, more social, and explicitly queer. A space where artists and models can interact, where conversation is welcome, and where curiosity matters more than perfection. A place where people feel comfortable showing up exactly as they are.

## What to Expect

Figure It Out events are relaxed and intentionally low-pressure.

Bring your own supplies if you like, but you don’t have to — we always have extras on hand if you forget. Come with a friend, or come solo and make a new one. You’re welcome to chat between poses, take breaks, and participate at whatever level feels right for you.

All skill levels are welcome. You don’t need to call yourself an artist to belong here.

## Models & Community

We work with queer models and prioritize consent, respect, and care for everyone in the room. Models are collaborators in the experience, not just subjects to be observed.

At its core, Figure It Out is about community. It’s a place to practice seeing — seeing form, seeing bodies, and seeing each other.

## Giving Back

Proceeds from Figure It Out events are donated to organizations that support queer communities and the arts, including:

- [Trans Lifeline](https://translifeline.org/)
- [Lifelong Washington](https://www.lifelong.org/)
- [Outreach International](https://outreach-international.org/)
- Youth arts programs like [Lambert House](https://www.lamberthouse.org/)

Showing up to draw is also a way to support something bigger than a single night.
